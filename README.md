# Movix

## 1. Project Description
Movix is a movie and TV show information web application built using **React + Vite**.

The project provides features like:
- Browse trending movies and shows
- Search by title
- View detailed information (overview, ratings, release date, etc.)
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
